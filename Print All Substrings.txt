For a given input string(str), write a function to print all the possible substrings.
Substring
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. 
Example: "cod" is a substring of "coding". Whereas, "cdng" is not as the characters taken are not contiguous
Input Format:
The first and only line of input contains a string without any leading and trailing spaces. All the characters in the string would be in lower case.
Output Format:
Print the total number of substrings possible, where every substring is printed on a single line and hence the total number of output lines will be equal to the total number of substrings.
Note:
The order in which the substrings are printed, does not matter.
Constraints:
0 <= N <= 10^6
Where N is the length of the input string.

Time Limit: 1 second
Sample Input 1:
abc
Sample Output 1:
a 
ab 
abc 
b 
bc 
c 


void printSubstrings(char input[]) {
  	int len = strlen(input);
	for(int k = 0 ; k<len ; k++ ){
		for(int i = k ; i<len ; i++){
		    for(int j = k ; j<=i ; j++){
		    	cout<<input[j];
			}
			cout<<endl;
		}
	}
}
